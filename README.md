# LSTM Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection in Household Power Consumption

This project implements an LSTM-based Autoencoder using PyTorch to detect anomalies in the UCI Household Electric Power Consumption dataset. It also includes K-Means clustering of the autoencoder's latent space representations to analyze data patterns.

## Project Overview

The primary goal is to identify unusual patterns in electricity usage that deviate significantly from normal consumption behavior learned by the autoencoder.

-   **Data:** Uses the [Individual household electric power consumption Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
-   **Model:** A PyTorch-based LSTM Autoencoder trained on hourly resampled data.
-   **Anomaly Detection:** Anomalies are identified based on reconstruction error exceeding a threshold derived from the training data distribution (e.g., 95th percentile).
-   **Clustering:** K-Means clustering is applied to the latent space vectors generated by the encoder to group similar consumption patterns.
-   **Visualization:** Includes plots of the time series with detected anomalies, reconstruction error distribution, and PCA visualization of latent space clusters.
